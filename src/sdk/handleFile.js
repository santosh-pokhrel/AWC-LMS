/**
 * The `awsParam` passed in the POST request to `/s/aws`
 * to get a pre-signed URL is retrieved from `window.awsParam`
 * on an Ontraport page. They inject it into the rendered page.
 *
 * It is a base64-encoded string, which decodes to
 * a serialized PHP Array (yeah I know, makes no sense).
 *
 * The only part that you really need is the `hash`
 * portion. The other property, `expiry`, can be calculated
 * on-demand, which is what the `encodeAwsParam()` helper
 * function will do for you (it's available in this file).
 *
 * Therefore, if you need to perform file uploads
 * outside an Ontraport page, you can still do so.
 * Simply use this function on an Ontraport page or
 * call it with the `awsParam` you get from an Ontraport page.
 * Then, save the `hash` property from the Object it returns.
 *
 * When you want to upload a file, pass that `hash` value to
 * the `encodeAwsParam()` helper function (available in this file).
 * It will create the proper `awsParam`
 * value to use in the POST request to `/s/aws`.
 * @param {string} [awsParam = window.awsParam] - Optionally
 * provide it, otherwise it will be assumed you're calling this
 * function from within an Ontraport page, and it will use
 * `window.awsParam`.

 *
 * @returns {{ expiry: ?number, hash: ?string }}
 * The decoded `awsParam` Object. All properties will
 * be available unless you provide an invalid `awsParam`.
 * That's the only reason they're documented as being
